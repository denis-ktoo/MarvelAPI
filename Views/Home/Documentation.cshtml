        <h2>Welcome to MarvelAPI Documentation</h2>
        <p>Your gateway to structured Marvel Universe data—characters, movies, planets, and series. Perfect for developers and Marvel fans alike!</p>
        
        <p>MarvelAPI provides RESTful access to categorized data via HTTP requests, delivering structured JSON responses. Use this guide to explore and interact with its resources effectively.</p>

        <p>We provide access to several core Marvel resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Characters:</strong> Information about the superheroes and villains in the Marvel Universe, including their names, aliases, affiliations, and home planets.</li>
            <li><strong>Movies:</strong> Data on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies, including release years, directors, and cast details.</li>
            <li><strong>Planets:</strong> Details about the different planets and realms in the Marvel Universe, such as Asgard, Xandar, and Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Series:</strong> TV series and mini-series from the Marvel Universe, including show names, seasons, and main characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each category has its own unique endpoint that you can interact with to retrieve data. Here’s how you can get started:</p>

        <h2>Base URL</h2>
        <p>The Base URL is the root URL for all API requests. If you ever make a request and receive a 404 NOT FOUND response, it's a good idea to check the Base URL first.</p>
        <p>The Base URL for the MarvelApi is:</p>
        <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/</pre>
        <p>The documentation below assumes you are prepending the Base URL to the endpoints in order to make requests.</p>


        <h2>Example Request:</h2>
        <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/planets/2</pre>
        <p>This request will fetch details about the planet <strong>Asgard</strong>, the realm of the gods. The response will include key information such as the planet's climate, terrain, population, and any characters associated with it. Here is an example of the expected response:</p>

        <pre class="json-response">
            {
              "id": 2,
              "name": "Asgard",
              "climate": "Temperate (magical)",
              "terrain": "Majestic cities, mountains",
              "population": 500000,
              "characters": [
                "https://localhost:7204/api/characters/3/",
                "https://localhost:7204/api/characters/30/",
                "https://localhost:7204/api/characters/101/",
                "https://localhost:7204/api/characters/108/",
                "https://localhost:7204/api/characters/111/"
              ]
            }
        </pre>

        <p>The MarvelAPI uses standard HTTP methods for interactions:</p>
        <p>However, only <strong>GET</strong> requests are allowed to fetch data. Other HTTP methods such as <strong>POST</strong>, <strong>PUT</strong>, and <strong>DELETE</strong> are not supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieve data from the API. For example, you can use a GET request to fetch a list of characters, planets, movies, or series.</li>
            <li><strong>POST:</strong> Not allowed. The API does not support submitting new data, such as creating characters or adding movies.</li>
            <li><strong>PUT:</strong> Not allowed. The API does not support updating existing data, such as modifying character details.</li>
            <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Not allowed. The API does not support removing data, such as deleting characters or movies.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Here are some additional examples of API requests you can try:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get details of a specific character: <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/characters/1</pre></li>
            <li>Get a list of all movies: <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/movies</pre></li>
            <li>Get details about a planet: <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/planets/3</pre></li>
            <li>Get a list of all series: <pre class="json-response">https://localhost:7204/api/series</pre></li>
        </ul>
